# Chapter V : Analysis & Feature Extraction

Once the data has been downloaded and preprocessed, the next step is to extract meaningful information from it. This phase is crucial in any remote sensing project, as it transforms raw pixel values into interpretable features for analysis or modeling.

In [*Analysis P1*](../V-Analysis/Analysis_P1.ipynb), we introduce an RGB display and some analysis function like spectral index, filter and image reduction (PCA).

In [*Analysis P2*](../V-Analysis/Analysis_P2.ipynb), we bring up unsupervised and supervised classsification like K-Means and Random Forest.
