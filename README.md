# RemoteSensingPlaybook

A beginner-friendly and pedagogical project designed to explain the key steps of remote sensing data processing using Python.  
This repository provides theoretical explanations and practical Jupyter notebooks to guide learners — including myself — through downloading, preprocessing, and analyzing satellite data.

Whether you're just starting out, revising key concepts, or exploring tools like GDAL, this playbook is made for you.

## Main Goals
- Learn remote sensing workflows step by step  
- Practice with well-commented Python code and Jupyter Notebooks  
- Share knowledge and make geospatial analysis more accessible  

## Project Structure

- [Chapter I – Introduction to Remote Sensing](I_Intro/)
- [Chapter II – Python Libraries for Remote Sensing](II_Libraries/)
- Chapter III – *To come...* (Downloading satellite data)
- Chapter IV – *To come...* (Preprocessing: alignment, reprojection, etc.)

More chapters will be added progressively as I learn and build.
