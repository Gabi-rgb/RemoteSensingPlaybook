# RemoteSensingPlaybook

A beginner-friendly and pedagogical project designed to explain the key steps of remote sensing data processing using Python.  
This repository provides theoretical explanations and practical Jupyter notebooks to guide learners — including myself — through downloading, preprocessing, and analyzing satellite data.

Whether you're just starting out, revising key concepts, or exploring tools like GDAL, this playbook is made for you.

## Main Goals
- Learn remote sensing workflows step by step  
- Practice with well-commented Python code and Jupyter Notebooks  
- Share knowledge and make geospatial analysis more accessible  

## Project Structure

| Chapter | Title                                           | Description                                  |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| I      | [Introduction to Remote Sensing](I_Intro/)       | Core concepts, sensors, resolutions, etc.    |
| II     | [Python Libraries for Remote Sensing](II_Libraries/) | Overview of key geospatial Python tools     |
| III    | *To come...*                                     | Downloading satellite data (web/API)         |
| IV     | *To come...*                                     | Preprocessing: alignment, reprojection, etc. |

More chapters will be added progressively as I learn and build.
