# RemoteSensingPlaybook

A beginner-friendly and pedagogical project designed to explain the key steps of remote sensing data processing using Python.  
This repository provides theoretical explanations and practical Jupyter notebooks to guide learners — including myself — through downloading, preprocessing, and analyzing satellite data.

Whether you're just starting out, revising key concepts, or exploring tools like GDAL, this playbook is made for you.

## Main Goals
- Learn remote sensing workflows step by step  
- Practice with well-commented Python code and Jupyter Notebooks  
- Share knowledge and make geospatial analysis more accessible  

## Topics covered
1. Introduction to remote sensing  
2. Key Python libraries for geospatial data (GDAL, NumPy, etc.)  
3. Downloading data from public sources and APIs  
4. Preprocessing: projection, alignment, etc.  
5. (To be continued...)
