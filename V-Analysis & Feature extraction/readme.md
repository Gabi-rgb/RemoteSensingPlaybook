# Chapter V : Analysis & Feature Extraction

Once the data has been downloaded and preprocessed, the next step is to extract meaningful information from it. This phase is crucial in any remote sensing project, as it transforms raw pixel values into interpretable features for analysis or modeling.

This section introduces common techniques used to extract features from satellite imagery and geospatial data.
